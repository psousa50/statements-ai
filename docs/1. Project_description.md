I’m starting a new software project and need your help to build production-ready code. Here’s the high-level idea:

A web application that allows users to upload bank statements in various formats (CSV, Excel, PDF). The system parses these files, extracts transaction data (date, description, amount), and stores it in a structured format. Users can review, categorize, and export their transactions.

Tech stack: FastAPI, React, PostgreSQL, Render, jest, Playwright

Please check all the latest versions of the tech stack.Do not use deprecated tools.

Please help me:
- Identify major components
